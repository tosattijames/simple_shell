# Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell
Low-level programming & Algorithm

PID & PPID
Exercises
0. getppid
Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does echo $$ print the same value? Why?

1. /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.

Arguments
0. av
Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using ac.

1. Read line
Write a program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.
man 3 getline

2. command line to av
Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.
man strtok
#advanced: Write the function without st
srtok

Executing a program

Creating processes

Wait

Exercise: fork + wait + execve
Write a program that executes the command ls -l /tmp in 5 different child processes. 
Each child should be created by the same process (the father). 
Wait for a child to exit before creating a new child.

Exercise: super simple shell
Using everything we saw, write a first version of a super simple shell that can run 
commands with their full path, without any argument.

File information
The stat (man 2 stat) system call gets the status of a file. On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

Exercise: find a file in the PATH
Write a program that looks for files in the current PATH.

Usage: _which filename ...

Environment

0. printenv with environ
Write a program that prints the environment using the global variable environ.

1. env vs environ
Write a program that prints the address of env (the third parameter of the main function) and environ (the global variable). Are they they same? Does this make sense?

2. getenv()
Write a function that gets an environment variable. (without using getenv)

Prototype: char *_getenv(const char *name);
man 3 getenv

3. PATH
Write a function that prints each directory contained in the the environment variable PATH, one directory per line.

4. PATH
Write a function that builds a linked list of the PATH directories.

5. setenv
Write a function that changes or adds an environment variable (without using setenv).

Prototype: int _setenv(const char *name, const char *value, int overwrite);
man 3 setenv

6. unsetenv
Write a function that deletes the variable name from the environment (without using unsetenv).

Prototype: int _unsetenv(const char *name);
man 3 unsetenv


main
